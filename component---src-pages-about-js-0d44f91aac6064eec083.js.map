Having later\n        upgraded to a desktop with Windows 95 my adolescent brain was blown as I\n        entertained myself with minesweeper, connecting to the internet using my\n        dialup connection and being amused by Clippy in Microsoft Word whilst\n        doing my homework. From that point on my career path had been set in\n        stone as I recognised I had to get a job that involved tech!\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        My first introduction to anything Software Engineer related was actually\n        in college as I was first introduced to a language called{\" \"}\n        <a\n          href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)\"\n          rel=\"nofollow\"\n          target=\"_blank\"\n        >\n          Pascal\n        </a>\n        . I still vividly remember carrying out my assignment in printing out\n        numbers from 1 to 100 and feeling like a true hacker.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Having progressed to university I later studied Computer Science with\n        Games Technology, as then I thought I was going to be a games developer.\n        I kind of got close to that career path as I worked as a games tester at\n        SAGA during my summer holidays (I even feature in the credits that\n        nobody reads of some of their games,{\" \"}\n        <a href=\"https://wiki.totalwar.com/w/Credits_(M2TW).html\">\n          Medieval Total War\n        </a>\n        ).\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        University had introduced me to Java (this was before the days Microsoft\n        had gone opensource and had free dev tools), and C++ which is\n        predominantly used with game engines due to the memory efficiencies. I\n        later also picked up C# whilst working on my final year thesis project.\n      </p>\n      <blockquote>\n        Its time to take off these academic shekels and venture into the working\n        world\n      </blockquote>\n      <p>\n        As soon as I wrapped up university in 2008 the{\" \"}\n        <a\n          rel=\"nofollow\"\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008\"\n        >\n          financial crisis\n        </a>{\" \"}\n        happened , which made finding a job challenging.
