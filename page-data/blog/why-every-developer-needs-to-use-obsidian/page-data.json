As my brain ðŸ§  ages these notes have become invaluable, and the need for quality notes over rushed pasted snippets has become more of a priority.</p>\n<p>Due to this I decided to revisit and reassess how I learn, and in doing so I ended up discovering <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Obsidian</a> which has been a game changer for me.

In the past I would always use free tools like <a href=\"www/draw.io\">draw.io</a> to make diagrams then paste in the exported jpg's into my notes.</p>\n<p>As a process I always found this really disconnected, and its even more jarring when you need to make edits and go through the whole export to jpeg flow all over again. I also find with these tools getting boxes to line up with connecting lines in a way that doesn't look a mess is incredibly fiddly and time consuming.</p>\n<p>One later evolution of this was <a href=\"https://plantuml.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Plant UML</a> which moves away from drawing diagrams to scripting, take this plantUML file as an example,</p>\n<deckgo-highlight-code   terminal=\"carbon\" line-numbers=\"true\" >\n          <code slot=\"code\">@startuml\n\nleft to right direction\n\nactor Guest as g\n\npackage Professional {\n  actor Chef as c\n  actor &quot;Food Critic&quot; as fc\n}\n\npackage Restaurant {\n  usecase &quot;Eat Food&quot; as UC1\n  usecase &quot;Pay for Food&quot; as UC2\n  usecase &quot;Drink&quot; as UC3\n  usecase &quot;Review&quot; as UC4\n}\n\nfc --&gt; UC4\ng --&gt; UC1\ng --&gt; UC2\ng --&gt; UC3\n\n@enduml</code>\n        </deckgo-highlight-code>\n<p><em>Taken from the plantUML's <a href=\"https://plantuml.com/use-case-diagram\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">usecase examples</a></em></p>\n<p>The above script produces the following diagram, note that the formatting/spacing and styling is all governed by plantUML syntax... there is absolutely no drawing involved.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/wjg1udsw901v/5jHzAIn4XYzmeeWbhn4yto/3154d97c8ed3f0c4456d3e7850ae6311/plantuml-example.png\" alt=\"PlantUML Example\"></p>\n<p>The benefit of this approach is you now have a change tracked diagram that can sit somewhere with your documentation (and as a bonus it formats everything for you). Aside from exporting the script as a .png making edits couldn't be easier.</p>\n<p>Whilst PlantUML is great it still take you away from your markdown document as you need to separately create the diagram and later paste in a link to the exported image. A later evolution on this is <a href=\"https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mermaid</a> which is similar to PlantUML but works within markdown as a code block. Having diagrams integrated means you no longer need to export diagrams to jpeg when adding to a markdown file... their just there.

It could be because I always target specific topics to learn and research into them rather than just free write so there's no real discovery of connections happening.

Hopefully this has given a good overview of the benefits from a engineers perspective.</p>\n<p>The only caveat to Obsidian is the lack of mobile apps (its currently being worked on, check out there roadmap on <a href=\"https://trello.com/b/Psqfqp7I/obsidian-roadmap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Trello</a>). But to be honest I haven't really felt the need for it as im always learning whilst on my computer.</p>\n<p>Obsidian is free try use (and fully functional with its free tier), they also have some paid tiers and boltons, so do check it out!</p>"}}},"related":{"edges":[{"node":{"title":"GatsbyJS SEO and Open Graph with Helmet","slug":"gatsby-seo-opengraph-helmet","hero":{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/wjg1udsw901v/6BwwZovIUzXkE7j7ZeVxM6/f7eed6871e869df95a84ef57d8df7ed6/gladiator-1931077_1280.jpg"},"title":"Helmet"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"why-every-developer-needs-to-use-obsidian","tags":["obsidian","research","notes","markdown","ownership","mermaid","git","knowledge-graph","ide","plantuml","open-graph"]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2040261982","2833800349","3159585216"]}
